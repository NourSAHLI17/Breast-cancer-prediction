# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting breast cancer using Python and machine learning. The goal is to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, build predictive models, and identify the most important factors influencing breast cancer diagnosis.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Predictive modeling using machine learning
- Feature importance analysis
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/NourSAHLI17/Diagnostic-cancer-du-sein.git
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your local environment.
3. Run the notebooks step by step to explore the analysis and prediction results.
